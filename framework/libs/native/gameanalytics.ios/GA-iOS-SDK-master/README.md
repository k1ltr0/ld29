#[GameAnalytics REST API](http://support.gameanalytics.com/forums/21598176-The-REST-API) wrapper for iOS


The GameAnalytics API iOS Wrapper is designed to send game event data to the GameAnalytics service for processing and visualization. By collecting data from players playing your game you will be able to identify bugs and balance issues, track purchases, and determine how the players really play your game.

The code for the GameAnalytics API iOS Wrapper is open source - feel free to create your own fork, or use the code to develop your own wrapper.

## GameAnalytics Full Documentation

You can find the [full documentation](http://support.gameanalytics.com/forums) on the Game Analytics website for wrappers, RESTful API, as well as information about how to collect useful data for your game.

## GameAnalytics Website

The GameAnalytics website can be found [here](http://www.gameanalytics.com/).
To start using the iOS API Wrapper you will have to create an account on the website and add your game.


##Requirements

- iOS 5 or later
- ARC
- XCode 4.4 is required for auto-synthesis.

##Installation

The best and easiest way is to use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the best way to manage library dependencies in Objective-C projects.
See the ["Getting Started"](http://cocoapods.org/#get_started) guide for more information.

If you haven't already, you need to install [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).
In a terminal, type the following commands:

	$ sudo gem install cocoapods
	$ pod setup
	
With CocoaPods installed create a file called Podfile next to your project with the following contents:

```ruby
platform :ios, '5.0'

pod "GA-iOS-SDK"
```

If you already have a Podfile, just add `pod "GA-iOS-SDK"` to the end of it.
Type pod install into your terminal.
An Xcode Workspace file will be generated next to your project â€” use it instead of xcodeproj.

### Alternatives
Not using CocoaPods? Here is alterative method.

1. Download latest version of GamesAnalytics iOS Wrapper binaries.
	The archive should contain these files:

	*`GameAnalytics.h`: The required header file containing methods for Games Analytics.*
	
	*`libGameAnalytics.a`: The required static library for Games Analytics.*
	
	Alternatively, you can use source code and build it yourself. 
	In case you already have the older version of the binaries, remove them from your project.

2. Click on your project's Frameworks > Add Files to "Your project name".

	![Add Files to](https://github.com/GameAnalytics/GA-iOS-SDK/raw/master/Screenshots/addfiles.png)
	
	Find and select the folder that contains the file named `libGameAnalytics.a`.
	The checkbox "Copy items into destination folder (if needed)" must be checked.
	Choose "Create groups for any added folders" and click Add.  
	
	![Select folder](https://github.com/GameAnalytics/GA-iOS-SDK/raw/master/Screenshots/selectfolder.png)
	
	The files `GameAnalytics.h` and `libGameAnalytics.a` should now be in your project.
	
	![Files added](https://github.com/GameAnalytics/GA-iOS-SDK/raw/master/Screenshots/filesadded.png)

3. Select your project, target and choose "Build Phases" tab.
	Expand the "Link Binary With Libraries" group and check if it contains `libGameAnalytic.a` library.
	
	![Link Binary With Libraries](https://github.com/GameAnalytics/GA-iOS-SDK/raw/master/Screenshots/linkbinary.png)
	
	In case it is not present there, drag and drop the library from your Project Navigator to the "Link Binary With Libraries" group.

4. In the "Link Binary With Libraries" group click the "+" to add new framework.
	Find the `SystemConfiguration.framework` in the list and click Add.
	
	![Add framework](https://github.com/GameAnalytics/GA-iOS-SDK/raw/master/Screenshots/addframework.png)
	
	`SystemConfiguration.framework` now should be listed under the "Link Binary With Libraries" group.
	
	![SystemConfiguration.framework](https://github.com/GameAnalytics/GA-iOS-SDK/raw/master/Screenshots/systemconfig.png)
	
	This is required for Reachability to manage network operations efficiently.
	
	Find the `AdSupport.framework` in the list and click Add.
	
	`AdSupport.framework` also should be listed under the "Link Binary With Libraries" group.
	
	This is required to get advertising Identifier on iOS6+.

5. Select your project, target and choose "Build Settings" tab.
	Under "Linking" group click on "Other Linker Flags" and add `-ObjC` flag. 
	
	![ObjC flag](https://github.com/GameAnalytics/GA-iOS-SDK/raw/master/Screenshots/objc.png)
	
6. In your project's build settings, find "Header Search Paths" and add $(SRCROOT) and check the box indicating a recurisve search.
	If the path to your project contains spaces, you must put $(SRCROOT) (as other custom search paths) in quotes.

	![SRCROOT](https://github.com/GameAnalytics/GA-iOS-SDK/raw/master/Screenshots/srcroot.png)

##Usage

Add the following line into your pre-compiled header file (`<projectname>_Prefix.pch`) 

    #import "GameAnalytics.h"
    
when using CocoaPods add following line instead
    
    #import <GA-iOS-SDK/GameAnalytics.h>

In your application delegate's `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method, add the following line to set your Game keys and Secret keys:

    [GameAnalytics setGameKey:@"__CHANGE_ME__" secretKey:@"__CHANGE_ME__" build:@"__CHANGE_ME__"];

Go to [GameAnalytic](http://www.gameanalytics.com) to register your game and get the game- and secret-key.

There are four different types of events to log: user, design, business, quality.
Each of these categories have different purposes, accept different values, and have certain required fields. 
Check the [full documentation](http://support.gameanalytics.com/forums) for more details. 
Add these method calls to your code to register every occurrence of the events.

###User data
